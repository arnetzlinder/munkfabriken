As a school assignment, given the Front End developer class of Medieinstitutet in the fall of 2022. This project was made by a group of students who named their group "Office hours" since that was their preferred hours of working.

The project was to create a web shop selling donuts. There was a bunch of special requirement of the made up customer, Gottfrid, that needed to be met in different ways. The project was executed during the first four weeks of the JavaScript course and the students were mainly beginners in JavaScript.
